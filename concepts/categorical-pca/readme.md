# Principal Compenent Analysis on Categorical Data

- [Correspondence Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis): Correspondence analysis 
(CA) or reciprocal averaging is a multivariate statistical technique proposed[1] by 
Herman Otto Hartley (Hirschfeld)[2] and later developed by Jean-Paul Benz√©cri.[3] 
It is conceptually similar to principal component analysis, but applies to categorical 
rather than continuous data. In a similar manner to principal component analysis, it 
provides a means of displaying or summarising a set of data in two-dimensional graphical form.

- [MCA on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_correspondence_analysis): In statistics, 
multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is a data analysis technique 
for nominal categorical data, used to detect and represent underlying structures in a data set. 
It does this by representing data as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The procedure 
thus appears to be the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data.[1][2] 
MCA can be viewed as an extension of simple correspondence analysis (CA) in that it is applicable 
to a large set of categorical variables.
